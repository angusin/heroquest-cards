This project serves 2 purposes:

1. Generate HQ cards for the game: monsters, heroes, artifacts and more.
2. Create a public repository of all the cards created by the community.

## Tech

- This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.4.
- [ng-2 Konva](https://github.com/konvajs/ng2-konva) was used to create the cards with HTML Canvas.
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) was used to create the UI.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build
